Introduction

Aim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Software Repository Managers 1.0 provide
orientation for software repository managers to define and implement their local software
management policies according to the requirements of the OpenAIRE - Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe. These guidelines are intended to provide indications on how to cite software products in order to make them first citizens of the scholarly communication ecosystem. 

The metadata from software archives should be included in the OpenAIRE information space, and exposed when the software is related to an open access publication e.g. a software referred by an article. 
By implementing the OpenAIRE Guidelines, software archive managers are facilitating the creation of enhanced publications and building the stepping-stones for a linked data infrastructure for research.

Exposure and visibility of content from a range of European repositories will be significantly increased when a common and interoperable approach is taken as well as adhering to existing guidelines. OpenAIRE is happy to assist in adherence to these guidelines. This compatibility will lead to future interoperability between research infrastructures, and structured metadata is of benefit to individual data repositories and the scholarly community at large.



The Guidelines take inspiration from DataCite, on the side of citation metadata, and from the OpenMinTed SHARE-OMTD software guidelines, available at https://guidelines.openminted.eu/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/recommended_schema_for_sw_resources.html
